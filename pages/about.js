          <p>SpaceX was formed by entrepreneur Elon Musk in the hopes of revolutionizing the aerospace industry and making affordable spaceflight a reality. The company entered the arena with the Falcon 1 rocket, a two-stage liquid-fueled craft designed to send small satellites into orbit.</p>
          <p>SpaceX scored its first big headline in 2010, when it became the first private company to launch a payload into orbit and return it to Earth intactâ€”something only government agencies like NASA or Russia's Roscosmos had done before. Its upright landing and recovery of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket on Dec.</p>
          <p>The point of this website is to show the past launches that SpaceX made and dive right into the details about the rockets.</p>
          <p>Enjoy it :)</p>
